<p style="text-align: center; font-family: Arial, Helvetica; font-size: 1em; margin:0px">   A zombie attack will most likely put a premium on basic survival items, such as water, food and first aid products.  One must purchase as much basic items before an attack. A good place to purchase these items is at Costco, where one could buy in bulk. </p>

<p style="text-align: center; font-family: Arial, Helvetica; font-size: 1em; margin:0px"> Next, go to your local gun store and purchase as many weapons as possible.  Given that zombies are already dead, it is important to have many weapons at your disposal.</p>

<p style="text-align: center; font-family: Arial, Helvetica; font-size: 1em; margin:0px"> As for physical training, one must be physically fit.  Zombies are aggressive but are very slow, so making sure to be cardio fit is a must.  Hit the gym and become a cardio pro!</p>

<p style="text-align: center; font-family: Arial, Helvetica; font-size: 1em; margin:0px"> Now you are ready to take on the undead!  The rest is a sit and wait game</p>
