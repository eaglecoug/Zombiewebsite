<p style="text-align: center; font-family: Arial, Helvetica; font-size: 1em; margin:0px">  You bought all your supplies and taken some MMA classes for good measure.  And now it happens, a full blown Zombie apocalypse.  You head outside and notice zombies running around everywhere.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: center; font-family: Arial, Helvetica; font-size: 1em; margin:0px"> Zombie's are slow, so if you are being followed by a zombie, then make sure to keep a good fast pace while fleeing.  Also run in a zig zag motion, this will slow the zombie's pace.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: center; font-family: Arial, Helvetica; font-size: 1em; margin:0px"> Stay in a place that is secure and where the windows are boarded up.  Zombies are terrible at picking locks, so make sure all locks are secure.  And make sure to have some entertainment like a xbox with a well-stocked cache of games.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: center; font-family: Arial, Helvetica; font-size: 1em; margin:0px"> Every so often take a peak outside to see if the zombies are gone. Once they are gone, then celebrate, YOU JUST SURVIVED A ZOMBIE APOCALYPSE!!!</p>
